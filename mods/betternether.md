# BetterNether
This mod was designed as improvement for the Nether, adding more biomes, plants and materials into it. I've tried to make its content unique and interesting for exploring as also useful.

Mod was designed as compatible with other nether mods (especially in world generation). For other desirable compatibilities please write on issue tracker.
