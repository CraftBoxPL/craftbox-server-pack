# Fabric Chunk Pregenerator
Fabric Chunk Pregenerator is a fabric mod that allows you to pregenerate chunks for your server or for singleplayer while running fabric. Requires Fabric API!

Please note that the pregenerator makes a square with the radius as distance from the edge on all sides! using 10 as the radius will create a 20x20 pregeneration region.
