# BetterSleepPlus
This mod modifies the vanilla sleeping mechanic in Minecraft by accelerating time depending on how many players sleep in total. This mod also brings the edition of a top bar, which indicates the time remaining of the night and thunder. This mod is suited for private servers that don't enjoy one-player sleep plugins because of their overpowered mechanics.
