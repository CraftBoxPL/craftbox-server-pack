# ClickThrough
This mod helps you access containers (chests, shulker boxes, barrels, but also hoppers, dispensers, ...) that are marked with a sign or item frame. Right-clicking a sign or item frame that's attached to a container will open the container instead.
Unlike other similar mods, it's purely client side, so it works on any kind of server - vanilla, modded, or spigot/paper.
You can still rotate items in item frames by sneaking and clicking them.
The same goes for signs that have some functionality attached by the server, for example, buy/sell signs on a server that has ChestShop or a similar plugin enabled.
