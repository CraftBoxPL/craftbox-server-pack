# Wither Skeleton Totem
If you believe that griding for mob drops is tedious, this mod attempts to make it more interesting using wither skeleton totems.
Near the totem, you are given a looting effect, the same as a looting II sword. And, if you kill any mob with a looting III sword and a totem is nearby, the total effect is looting V.
But be careful, because monsters nearby will gain strength II and speed.
