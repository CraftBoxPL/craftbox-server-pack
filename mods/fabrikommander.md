# FabriKommander
FabriKommander is a utility mod for server administrators and modpack creators alike. It provides a set of useful quality-of-life tools, primarily for players but with administrator features planned for the future!

In its current state, it simply provides a set of server-side commands. This means that you don't have to install it on the client â€” but the commands will work in single-player too!
