# Dazzle 2
This is Dazzle 2, a mod that adds way more redstone lamps than you'll ever want or need. And a few other things that I thought were interesting. But mostly redstone lamps.

- 320 redstone lamps (5 styles, 16 colors, digital/analog, regular/inverted)
- A light sensor - works like a daylight sensor, but detects block light
- Invisible torches
- Projected light panels, that cast light up to 45 blocks away
- A dimmer version of the vanilla redstone torch
- Colored flare lights, that emit happy little particles
