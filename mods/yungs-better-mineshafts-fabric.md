# YUNG's Better Mineshafts (Fabric)Vanilla mineshafts old and bad.
These mineshafts? Very cool. Not so bad.

This mod completely revamps vanilla abandoned mineshafts, changing them from boring straight lines into dynamic, varied webs of tunnels.
Find loot tucked away in the corners of abandoned workstations, or out in the open in a chest on a minecart.
