# YUNG's Better Caves (Fabric)
YUNG's Better Caves completely overhauls Minecraft's cave systems. Caves are small and unassuming at the surface, but the deeper you go, the crazier things get. You'll find lava caverns, underground lakes and rivers, flooded caverns, and more!

Better Caves is the most powerful and customizable Minecraft cave mod, with dozens of options and support for dimension-specific configurability. Want the Nether to have some worm-like caves? You got it. Want The Beneath to be spotted with treacherous lakes filled with poison? Easy. For information on how to use the extensive configuration, [see the wiki](https://github.com/yungnickyoung/YUNGs-Better-Caves/wiki)!
