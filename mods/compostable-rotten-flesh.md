# Compostable Rotten Flesh (Fabric)
Do you have way to much rotten flesh, that you don't need?
I always felt like rotten flesh should be compostable, so I made this mod.
This lightweight mod is required on the server and can be on the client as well, however I tested it and having it only on the server worked fine, but the eating animation is displayed while putting the rotten flesh into the composter.
